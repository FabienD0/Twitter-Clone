# Twitter-Clone

To improve my React skills, I had to build the entire frontend of a Twitter clone named "Critter" a social network for cats. The backend was already built. During this project, I was faced with many challenges, but everything worked out in the end. 

Here's a list of the skills that I applied to this project;

- Styled Components
- Router
- React State
- React Effects
- React Fetch
- React Context
- React Navigate
- React useParams
- React Tippy

## Functionality
### View a "home feed"
When navigating to the root URL /, the user see a list of tweets from the accounts that the current user follows.

### Posting a new tweet
On the homepage, the user is able to create a new tweet by writing in the box and clicking "Meow":

>There's a "remaining characters" indicator, which shifts colors as the user approaches/surpasses the limit. 
The user is not be able to submit a tweet that has exceeded the limit.
